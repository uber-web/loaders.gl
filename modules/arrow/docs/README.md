# Arrow JavaScript API

> The material in this section is assembled from various Apache Arrow docs under MIT license.

To tap into the full power of Arrow formatted data, it is necessary to use the Arrow API directly. A typical use case is doing data frame type manipulations on the Arrow encoded data.

> This is temporary Arrow API documentation, it may be phased out when official docs for the Arrow JavaScript API become available...

Note: The JavaScript Arrow API is designed to be close match to the C++ Arrow API, although some differences have been made where it makes sense. There are some unique capabilities as well as some missing features.
