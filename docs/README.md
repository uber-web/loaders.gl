## Overview

loaders.gl is a is a collection of the best open source loaders and writers for file formats focused on visualization of big data, including point clouds, 3D geometries, images, geospatial formats as well as tabular data.

loader.gl is packaged and published as a composable module suite with consistent APIs and features across the suite, and supports advanced features such as running loaders on workers and incremental loading (streaming) in a consistent way across the entire suite, and all loaders work in both the browser and in Node.js.

loaders.gl is framework-agnostic, and all loaders and writers are designed to be usable with any JavaScript application or framework with a minimal amount of glue code.

Naturally, other [vis.gl frameworks](https://vis.gl/frameworks) such as [deck.gl](https://deck.gl) and [luma.gl](https://luma.gl) are designed to integrate seamlessly with loaders.gl.

## Loaders

loaders.gl provides a wide selection of loaders organized into categories:

| Category                                                         | Loaders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Code Examples

loaders.gl provides a small core API module with common functions to load and save data, and a range of optional modules that provide loaders and writers for specific file formats.

A minimal example using the `load` function and the `CSVLoader` to load a CSV formatted table into a JavaScript array:

```js
import {load} from '@loaders.gl/core';
import {CSVLoader} from '@loaders.gl/csv';

const data = await load('data.csv', CSVLoader);

for (const row of data) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(row)); // => '{header1: value1, header2: value2}'
}
```

Streaming parsing is available using ES2018 async iterators, e.g. allowing "larger than memory" files to be incrementally processed:

```js
import {loadInBatches} from '@loaders.gl/core';
import {CSVLoader} from '@loaders.gl/csv';

for await (const batch of await loadInBatches('data.csv', CSVLoader)) {
  for (const row of batch) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(row)); // => '{header1: value1, header2: value2}'
  }
}
```

To quickly get up to speed on how the loaders.gl API works, please see [Get Started](docs/developer-guide/get-started).

## Supported Platforms

loaders.gl provides consistent support for both browsers and Node.js. The following platforms are supported:

- **Evergreen Browsers** loaders.gl supports recent versions of the major evergreen browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on both desktop and mobile.
- **Node.js** LTS (Long-Term Support) [releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) are also supported through the `@loaders.gl/polyfills` module.
- **Edge and IE11** are not actively supported, however loaders.gl 2.3 is known to run on Edge and IE11. Both `@loaders.gl/polyfills` and additional appropriate polyfills (e.g. babel polyfills) need to be installed which will increase your application bundle size. For loaders.gl 3.0, additional transpilation of your `node_modules` folder may also be required. Note that because of lack of regualar testing on these older platforms, regressions can occur. Pinning your loaders.gl version is advisable.

## Main Design Goals

**Framework Agnostic** - Files are parsed into clearly documented data structures (objects + typed arrays) that can be used with any JavaScript framework.

**Worker Support** - Many loaders run in web workers, keeping the main thread free for other tasks while parsing completes.

**Streaming Support** - Several loaders can parse in batches from both node and browser `Stream`s, allowing "larger than memory" files to be processed, and initial results to be available while the remainder of a file is still loading.

**Node Support** - All loaders work under Node.js and can be used when writing backend and cloud services, and when running your unit tests under Node.

**Loader Categories** - loaders.gl groups similar data formats into "categories". loaders in the same category return parsed data in "standardized" form, simplifying applications that want to handle multiple related formats.

**Format Autodection** - Applications can specify multiple loaders when parsing a file, and loaders.gl will automatically pick the right loader for a given file based on file extension, MIME type and file header.

**Bundle Size Optimized** - Each format is published as an independent npm module to allow applications to cherry-pick only the loaders it needs, modules are optimized for tree-shaking, large loader libraries and workers are loaded from CDN and not bundled.

**Modern JavaScript** - loaders.gl is written in standard ES2018 and the API emphasizes modern, portable JavaScript constructs, e.g. async iterators instead of streams, `ArrayBuffer` instead of `Buffer`, etc.

**Binary Data Optimized** - loaders.gl is optimized for use with WebGL frameworks (e.g. by returning typed arrays whenever possible). However, there are no any actual WebGL dependencies and loaders can be used without restrictions in non-WebGL applications.

**Multi-Asset Loading** - Some formats like glTF, or mipmapped cube textures, can required dozens of separate loads to resolve all linked assets (external buffers, images etc). Tracking all the resulting async loads can cause complications for applications. By default, loaders.gl loads all linked assets before resolving a returned `Promise`.

## Licenses

loaders.gl contains code under several permissive open source licenses, currently MIT, BSD and Apache licenses. Additional licenses might be included in the future, however loaders.gl will never include code with non-permissive, commercial or copy-left licenses.

Note that each loader module comes with its own license, so if the distinction matters to you, please check and decide accordingly.

## Credits and Attributions

loaders.gl is maintained by a group of organizations collaborating through open governance under the Linux Foundation.

loaders.gl is partly a repackaging of superb work done by many others in the open source community. We try to be as explicit as we can about the origins and attributions of each loader, both in the documentation page for each loader and in the preservation of comments relating to authorship and contributions inside forked source code.

Even so, we can make mistakes, and we may not have the full history of the code we are reusing. If you think that we have missed something, or that we could do better in regard to attribution, please let us know.
